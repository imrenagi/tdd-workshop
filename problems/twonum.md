Given an array of integers and one integer x, return array of indices of the two numbers such that they add up to x.
- If the array size is less than 0, then return error "invalid array. length must be equal or greater than 2"
- If the target is not found, return empty array of indices
- If the target is found, return the indices in order as they appear.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
